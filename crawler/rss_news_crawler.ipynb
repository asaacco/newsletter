Founded in 2021, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance is a coalition of more than 140 banks spanning 44 countries and representing approximately $73 trillion in assets. Members of the NZBA commit to transitioning operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their financing activities to align with net zero pathways by 2050, and to set 2030 financed emissions targets, initially focused on key emissions intensive sectors. Earlier this year, the group issued new guidelines for climate target setting for banks, expanding its requirements to include a commitment to align capital markets activities such as debt and equity underwriting to bank’s 2050 net zero goals, in addition to the prior lending-focused commitment. Wells Fargo joined the group in October 2021, after setting its own climate targets earlier that year, including goals to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050, including emissions attributable to financing.\",\n",

In that time, there has been widespread commentary and analysis of the gathering – much of it fatalistic and critical. In some corners, it’s been described as ‘no longer fit for purpose’ while others have spoken of the ‘dark forces’ driving the negotiations towards dead ends. I’ve attending COP meetings for many years and I’ve watched as the number of delegates and the number of countries and territories represented has ballooned. While the growth in the number of voices has slowed down some of the rapid progress I witnessed in the COP early years, I believe some of the criticism is overblown and risks jeopardizing some of the real achievements that are being made.\",\n",

The retail giant said that it will continue to work towards its “aspirational goal of zero emissions by 2040,” but warned that “progress will not be linear.”\\nWalmart set its 2040 net zero goal in 2020, outlining at the time a series of initiatives it would pursue to achieve its goal, including sourcing 100% renewable energy to power its facilities with by 2035, electrifying and zeroing out emissions from all of its vehicles – including long-haul trucks – by 2040, and transitioning to low-impact refrigerants for cooling and electrified equipment for heating in its stores, clubs, and data and distribution centers by 2040. The company highlighted the progress it has made on some of these initiatives, including reaching 48% renewable sources for its global electricity needs in 2023, putting the company on track towards its renewables goal, and noted that it has reduced carbon intensity, or emissions per unit of revenue, by 45% on a 2015 basis, although overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions have declined by only 19.3%, due to the company’s growth. Despite its progress, however, Walmart said that its progress will be held back by a series of factors, including energy policy and infrastructure in its global markets, as well as clean technology issues, such as “availability of more cost-effective low-GWP refrigeration and HVAC solutions, and timely emergence of cost-effective technologies for low-carbon heavy tractor transportation (which does not appear likely until the 2030s).”\\nThe company said that these factors are expected to delay its achievement of its interim 2025 and 2030 emissions reduction goals, and that it will consider revising its targets next year. Outlining some of the key challenges to its climate strategy in the update, Walmart said:\\n“Achieving our targets and/or aspirations will require innovation and technology that is not available or economically viable, or fully scalable today, including the evolution, accessibility, and/or adoption of renewable energy, lower-GWP refrigeration systems, vehicles powered by renewable sources of energy, and regenerative agricultural technologies.\",\n",

The release of the new standards marks a significant step in the multi-year process towards establishing a new sustainability reporting system in Canada, beginning in 2021, with a directive from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to cabinet ministers to move towards a system of reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Most recently, in October, the government announced plans to introduce mandatory climate-related reporting for large companies, with smaller companies to be encouraged to voluntarily provide climate-related disclosures. The CSSB was formed in 2022 to work with the ISSB, and to support the uptake of ISSB standards in Canada. The new standards include CSDS 1, General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information, and CSDS 2, Climate-related Disclosures, which correspond with the ISSB’s IFRS S1 (sustainability-related) and IFRS S2 (climate-related) standards, while including modifications “reflecting the Canadian context.”\\nThe CSSB initially released proposed sustainability and climate reporting standards in March 2024, which included a series of modifications from the ISSB standards, most notably pushing off the effective date by a year, and extending 1-year reliefs provided by the ISSB for reporting on sustainability matters beyond climate and on Scope 3 value chain emissions to 2 years.\",\n",
